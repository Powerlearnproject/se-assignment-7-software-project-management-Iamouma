(3). Client Satisfaction: Ensures that all deliverables are accepted by the client, contributing to client satisfaction and potential future business.

(4). Resource Management: Releases project resources, making them available for other projects, and ensures efficient use of organizational assets.

(5). Documentation: Finalizes project documentation, providing a comprehensive record that can be referenced for future maintenance or similar projects.

(6). Financial Closure: Closes all financial accounts, ensuring that the project budget is fully reconciled and any remaining funds are appropriately allocated.

(7). Risk Mitigation: Addresses any outstanding risks or issues, ensuring that they do not impact future operations or projects.
